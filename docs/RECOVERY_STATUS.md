## Current Automated Baseline

```text
Non-smoke, non-container tests: 266 passed, 0 failed
Smoke tests:                    20 passed, 0 failed
SQL Server integration tests:  32 passed, 0 failed (last measured July 18; not re-run this pass)
Browser E2E journeys:            3 passed, 0 failed (last measured July 18; not re-run this pass)
```

The counts above describe this branch's latest recorded verification (2026-07-25). Feature branches may add coverage; each pull request should report its own build and test evidence rather than silently overwriting historical results. The non-smoke/smoke counts were re-run and confirmed on 2026-07-25; the SQL Server integration and E2E counts are carried over from the July 18 baseline and should be re-verified against a live SQL Server/browser environment before relying on them.

Latest loop evidence: the raw `docs/loop-runs/*.md` logs (2026-06-15 through 2026-07-25) were pruned as stale build/test snapshots superseded by the summary above; still available in git history if needed.

Latest direct Week 1 baseline evidence:

- `./scripts/verify-backend.sh`: restore passed, build passed, 172 non-smoke tests passed.
- `RUN_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/verify-backend.sh`: restore passed, build passed, 172 non-smoke tests passed, Testing-mode app started at `http://localhost:5187`, 20 smoke tests passed.
- `docker compose up -d`: SQL Server container started.
- `docker compose ps`: `okafor-mssql` reported healthy.
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5190 dotnet run --no-launch-profile`: app connected to SQL Server, migrations reported no pending updates, seed checks ran, and app listened on `http://localhost:5190`.
- `curl -fsS http://localhost:5190/health`: returned `Healthy`.
- `./scripts/check-seeded-admin.sh`: confirmed at least one SQL-backed user has the Admin role.
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5191 dotnet run --no-launch-profile`: app connected to SQL Server, migrations reported no pending updates, and app listened on `http://localhost:5191`.
- SQL-backed curl flow: fresh patient registration, confirmation-link page, unconfirmed login rejection, confirmed login success, profile creation, in-person appointment slot booking, phone teleconsultation rejection, video teleconsultation submission, and portal history/document pages.

Latest July 12 baseline evidence:

- `dotnet build Okafor-.NET.csproj --no-restore`: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `dotnet build tests/Okafor.NET.Tests/Okafor.NET.Tests.csproj --no-restore`: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `dotnet test tests/Okafor.NET.Tests/Okafor.NET.Tests.csproj --no-build --filter "Category!=Smoke"`: 182 passed, 0 failed.
- `RUN_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/verify-backend.sh`: restore and build passed, 182 non-smoke tests passed, and 20 hosted smoke tests passed.
- `npm run build:css`: Tailwind CSS compiled successfully.
- `node --check` over first-party `wwwroot/js/*.js`: all files parsed successfully.

Latest July 18 baseline evidence:

- `RUN_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/verify-backend.sh`: build passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors, 232 non-smoke/non-container tests passed, and 20 hosted smoke tests passed.
- `./scripts/verify-database-integration.sh`: 32 SQL Server Testcontainers tests passed.
- `dotnet test`: 264 self-contained app tests and 3 browser E2E journeys passed; the raw command's 20 smoke cases require the repository smoke harness above to start the app.
- `DemoDataSeedTests`: environment-policy and placeholder-secret cases passed, proving fictional content seeds default to Development only and that the hosted preview (which runs as `Staging`) cannot publish demo clinicians, news, or appointment records.

## Not Fully Verified Yet

These require browser interaction, local credentials, or real provider credentials:

- Seeded admin browser login against SQL Server. SQL-backed Admin role assignment exists, but browser sign-in still needs the owner-controlled local password.
- Full appointment request to admin approval workflow.
- Full teleconsultation request to admin status update workflow.
- Patient document upload/delete, messages, and appointment cancellation.
- Mock donation and bill payment flows against SQL Server.
- Paystack sandbox payment flow and signed webhook.
- SMTP live email delivery.
- Africa's Talking SMS delivery.
- WhatsApp Cloud API outbound templates and live webhook conversation.
- Browser push notification delivery.
- Browser PWA install/offline checks.

## Next Verification Move

Set a local `SeedAdmin:Password` with user secrets, restart the app, then confirm the admin login. After that, walk `docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` from top to bottom. Move feature statuses in `docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` from `Code-present` to `Verified` only after the checklist item passes.

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "SeedAdmin:Password" "use-a-local-strong-password"
dotnet user-secrets set "SeedAdmin:Email" "admin@example-hospital.local"
```
