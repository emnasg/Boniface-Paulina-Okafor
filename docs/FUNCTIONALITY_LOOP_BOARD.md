# Functionality Loop Board

This board separates work Codex can keep improving from work the owner must personally complete or confirm. Owner tasks stay unchecked until the owner says they are done.

## Codex-Lane Backlog

### Five-Week Backend And DevOps Launch Sprint

Source plan: removed 2026-09-01 (`docs/LAUNCH_SPRINT_PLAN.md`, largely completed); current status lives in `docs/RECOVERY_STATUS.md`.

- [ ] Week 1: Establish launch board, baseline verification, SQL Server Development verification, CI confidence, and privacy/security checklist.
- [ ] Week 2: Prove appointment and teleconsultation workflows end to end with SQL-backed persistence and admin review.
- [ ] Week 3: Harden patient portal, admin operations, authorization, document uploads, and sensitive-data handling.
- [ ] Week 4: Verify payments, notifications, PWA/offline behavior, staging deployment, secrets, TLS, and monitoring.
- [ ] Week 5: Freeze scope, run staging launch rehearsal, validate rollback/backup plans, and prepare production release.

### Landing Page Redesign

Goal: frontend-team lane. Redesign only the public landing page. Backend/DevOps should support route contracts and verification, but should not own the visual redesign unless a backend route or data contract blocks the frontend team.

- [x] Redesign the landing-page hero so the first viewport feels polished, trustworthy, and clearly hospital-specific. (Hero carousel with touch/keyboard support, shipped `wwwroot/js/hero-carousel.js`.)
- [x] Rework the care shortcuts and primary calls to action so appointment, teleconsultation, emergency/contact, services, and patient info paths are easy to scan. (`.hospital-care-dock` below the hero.)
- [x] Replace the current long linear homepage flow with a more professional section rhythm using real hospital imagery, concise copy, and clearer visual hierarchy. (intro/partner/routes/mission/team/services/learning/gallery/updates/contact sections in `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`.)
- [x] Add stronger trust and service proof using existing seeded departments, doctors, posts, hospital contact config, and available hospital images. (Care-team preview section added, backed by `Doctor.IsFeatured` + `HomeController.Index()`; falls back to real doctors when none are marked featured.)
- [x] Improve mobile landing-page spacing, typography, button wrapping, and care shortcut behavior. (`@media (max-width: 719.98px)` block in `public-site.css`.)
- [x] Normalize the landing-page visual system in `wwwroot/css/public-site.css` without spilling styles into admin, patient portal, identity, payment, or form pages. (All top-level selectors scoped under `.hospital-home`/`.public-home`/`.public-wrap`/`.editorial-*`.)
- [x] Verify landing-page accessibility basics: semantic headings, useful alt text, visible focus states, contrast, reduced-motion behavior, and no text overlap. Semantic headings, alt text, `:focus-visible`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and no-horizontal-overflow are covered by `ResponsiveDesignTests`/`AccessibilityTests`/the Playwright E2E suite (against the real files, not fake string literals). Contrast is now covered by `ColorContrastTests`, which computes real WCAG 2.1 AA ratios for the actual text/background color pairs extracted from `site.css`/`tailwind.input.css` (body text, kickers, button labels, the top utility bar) — all pass. This is a code-level contrast check, not a full visual/perceptual audit; a human eye pass is still worth doing before launch but is no longer a blind spot.
- [ ] Run focused route/style verification after redesign and record manual checks for desktop and mobile landing-page review. No manual review record exists yet in `docs/loop-runs/` or elsewhere — still open.

### Verification Automation

- [x] Add backend verification script for build, non-smoke tests, and smoke tests.
- [x] Add Linux `dotnet watch` helper for inotify/polling issues.
- [x] Add Development SQL smoke script that starts/checks SQL Server and verifies `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
- [x] Add a script or test helper for seeded admin existence once local secrets are set. (`scripts/check-seeded-admin.sh` plus the runtime `admin-account` health check registered in `Program.cs` under `/health/ready`.)
- [x] Add CI artifacts and log guidance for failed Linux smoke and Windows test runs.

### Production Data Safety

- [x] Prevent fictional doctors, posts, and appointment records from being seeded during Production startup.

### Deployment And Recovery

- [x] Replace the generic VM deployment guide with an Azure Container Apps revision-based release and rollback runbook.
- [x] Add an Azure SQL plus Azure Files backup/restore runbook and pre-launch drill record.
- [ ] Execute a production-like staging rehearsal and record the result.
- [ ] Execute the isolated backup/restore drill and record measured RPO/RTO.

### Public Workflows

- [x] Add integration test for appointment request form submission (verified against SQL Server, exceeding the original `Testing`-mode target).
- [x] Add integration test for contact form submission (verified through the admin inbox against SQL Server).
- [x] Add route/content smoke coverage for About, Services, News, and Contact pages.
- [x] Add regression test for WhatsApp floating widget link generation.

### Appointment And Scheduling

- [x] Add integration coverage for appointment request creation and persistence.
- [x] Add service/controller coverage for doctor-by-department lookup.
- [x] Add tests for slot booking collision prevention.
- [x] Add admin approval/rejection workflow tests where practical.

### Teleconsultations

- [x] Add smoke/integration coverage for teleconsultation create page.
- [x] Add integration coverage for teleconsultation submission.
- [x] Add admin teleconsultation status update coverage.
- [x] Add patient teleconsultation history coverage.

### Patient Portal

- [x] Add patient, staff, and admin authorization tests for protected routes.
- [x] Add profile create/edit tests.
- [x] Add document upload validation tests.
- [x] Add message send/list tests.
- [x] Add appointment cancellation tests.

### Payments

- [x] Add mock donation flow tests.
- [x] Add mock bill payment flow tests.
- [x] Add Paystack webhook signature negative test.
- [x] Add receipt page route tests.

### Notifications

- [x] Add notification provider selection tests.
- [x] Add WhatsApp webhook invalid signature/invalid token tests.
- [x] Add push subscription controller tests for invalid payloads.
- [x] Add email fallback/logging tests for receipt senders.

### PWA And Offline

- [x] Keep service worker and PWA registration tests passing.
- [x] Add smoke coverage for `offline.html`, `offline-appointments.html`, and `site.webmanifest`.
- [x] Add test coverage for private/admin/payment/upload/hub route cache exclusions.
- [x] Add browser manual checklist for install prompt and offline appointment sync. (Step-by-step checklist added to `docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` under "PWA And Offline," covering desktop/Android/iOS install-prompt behavior and offline appointment sync. Writing the checklist is Codex-lane; actually running it on real devices is Owner-lane manual QA, still open in that section below.)

### Documentation And Collaboration

- [x] Add collaboration workflow documentation.
- [x] Add feature inventory.
- [x] Add recovery plan and verification checklist.
